# OSDev
Some random OSDev stuff. 

Some code may or may not be mine. If it doesn't explicitly say so, the code probably originates from OSDev Forums, or https://wiki.osdev.org

This is in zero way a proper way to learn OS Development. I am a novice who will probably never create something amounting to anything, so please, go read some proper books or tutorials. If you really want to learn, go read the Baby Bones tutorial.
