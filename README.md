# OSDev
Some random OSDev stuff. 

Some code may or may not be mine. If it doesn't explicitly say so, the code probably originates from OSDev Forums, or https://wiki.osdev.org

This is in zero way a proper way to learn OS Development. I am a novice who will probably never create something amounting to anything, so please, go read some proper books or tutorials. If you really want to learn, go read the Baby Bones tutorial.

# What does this Repo include?
Some sample code you can look at. Aside from that, there is a compilation script that I use to compile my OS. It's built for the way I structured my source folder. If you use a different setup, try changing it up a bit.

# Features?
So, what's in here? Not much. I started by looking at the Baby Bones tutorial from the OSDev forums. I've blatantly copied it, as you can see, so that I could get a good look at starting on. So far I've implemented newline characters, and that's about it.

# What next?
I'll be looking into adding a few simple features. The ability to print different colored text is probably up next on the list.
